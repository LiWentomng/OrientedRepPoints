            positive bbox. Positive samples can have smaller IoU than
            pos_iou_thr due to the 4th step (assign max IoU sample to each gt).

        ignore_iof_thr (float): IoF threshold for ignoring bboxes (if
            `gt_bboxes_ignore` is specified). Negative values mean not
            ignoring any bboxes.

            assign. When the number of gt is above this threshold, will assign
            on CPU device. Negative values mean not assign on CPU.
